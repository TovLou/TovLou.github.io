      <h2>Early years: What federal Indian agents reported 1874 to 1906 </h2>

      <p>These excerpts from reports filed by Indian agents describe how the Utah boarding schools worked year by year to assimilate children.</p>
      <p>They also document decades of resistance by Ute families who frustrated that goal — from refusing to enroll students, to running away, to continuing to speak their own language, to maintaining their bonds and traditions.  </p>

    <h3><strong>1870s — A day school struggles</strong></h3>
    <p>Indian Agent J.J. (John James) Critchlow was the first Uintah Valley agent to attempt opening a school for the Utes, starting with a day school in 1874. It would open and close, for lack of funds and interest, as Critchlow argued unsuccessfully for the funds to open a boarding school.</p>
    <p><strong>1874:</strong> “We hope to have … our school in operation this fall.”</p>
    <p><strong>1875:</strong> “We must have another building, for boarding and lodging purposes.”</p>
    <p><strong>1876:</strong> “I did not think the results justified the expense. I … closed the school.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6642kdx/369650"><strong>1877:</strong></a> “Our school has been suspended … for the want of funds.”</p>
    <p><strong>1878:</strong> “I sincerely hope … that greater facilities may be afforded for their moral training.”</p>
    <p><strong>1879:</strong> “... Best results can only be secured by a boarding industrial school, where the children … can be separated from their families.” </p>
