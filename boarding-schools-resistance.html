-->
    <p>Decade after decade, federal Indian agents tried to change nearly everything about members of the Ute tribe: how they lived, their language, their faith traditions, what they wore, what they ate — and the family bonds that would ensure their culture endured.  </p>

</section>
<section class="container story-container">
<p>Many parents refused to have their children exposed to one of the key assimilation strategies: federal boarding schools, either those built in other states or the two that opened on the reservation. Some children who were sent — or were collected by officials — ran away. Many refused to stop speaking their own language, although it was forbidden at school. Families reconnected on breaks and during the summers and at Bear Dances.</p>
    <h2>“The unsubdued attitude of the Utes” </h2>
    <p>In 1896, a superintendent complained that Ute mothers saw the boarding schools as a plot — which, arguably, they were, against Ute culture and lifeways. After summer break, "we found much of our work had been unraveled by the camp mothers, who cling so tenaciously to the traditions and customs of their tribe,” Charles A. Walker wrote, “and regard the education so lavishly extended by the Government as merely a plot of the white man against their liberties and possessions."</p>
    <p>hat Indian agents framed — often in racist terms — as disobedience and disinterest was resistance.</p>
    <p>The reports also show Ute students staying connected to their families — refusing to stop speaking Ute, taking yeast home to make bread at their family’s tepee, bringing fabric from home to sew clothing at school for a favorite brother or sister. </p>

    <h2>“We put a lot of culture into our school”</h2>
    <p>Studies dating back a century show that Native students learn best and succeed when their language and culture are present in their education. Uintah River High serves as an example of what could happen if the Uinta Basin’s public school districts followed those recommendations.
