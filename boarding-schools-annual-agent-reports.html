      <h2>Early years: What federal Indian agents reported 1874 to 1906 </h2>

      <p>These excerpts from reports filed by Indian agents describe how the Utah boarding schools worked year by year to assimilate children.</p>
      <p>They also document decades of resistance by Ute families and students who frustrated that goal — from refusing to enroll students, to running away, to continuing to speak their own language, to maintaining their bonds and traditions.  </p>

    <p>Many of the reports contain racist language and stereotypes.</p>

    <p>In the school excerpts, we’ve included superintendents’ reports when they were available and additional reporting.</p>

    <h3><strong>1870s — A day school struggles</strong></h3>
    <p>Indian Agent J.J. (John James) Critchlow was the first Uintah Valley agent to attempt opening a school for the Utes, starting with a day school in 1874. It would open and close, for lack of funds and interest, as Critchlow argued unsuccessfully for the funds to open a boarding school.</p>
    <p><strong>1874: </strong>“We hope to have … our school in operation this fall.”<br />

    <h3>1880s — Uintah Boarding School opens</h3>
    <p>Agent J. J. Critchlow succeeded in convincing the Presbyterian Board of Missions to open and run a boarding-school on the Uintah Valley reservation — but the church’s involvement would be short-lived. The new school opened in January 1881, and by 1883, the federal government had taken over. This decade saw a more rapid turnover of agents after Critchlow’s departure in 1883.</p>
    <p><strong>1880: </strong>“We …  hope to be ready by the 1st of November to inaugurate our school.” <br />

    <h3>1890s — Ouray Boarding School opens</h3>
    <p>Efforts to get Ute children into school intensified this decade, as new buildings were added at the Uintah school in Whiterocks and a second boarding school opened for the Uncompahgre band. But parents continued to resist sending their children.</p>
    <p><strong>1890: </strong>Staff “labor under great difficulties” with “dilapidated” Uintah school building. <br />New Indian Agent Robert Waugh <br />

    <h3>1900s —</h3>
    <p>The Ouray school at Randlett was abandoned this decade, with all Utes encouraged to send their children to Whiterocks. A few were sent to boarding schools in other states, including the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.</p>
