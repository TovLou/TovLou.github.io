      <h2>Early years: What federal Indian agents reported 1874 to 1906 </h2>

      <p>These excerpts from reports filed by Indian agents describe how the Utah boarding schools worked year by year to assimilate children.</p>
      <p>They also document decades of resistance by Ute families who frustrated that goal — from refusing to enroll students, to running away, to continuing to speak their own language, to maintaining their bonds and traditions.  </p>

    <h3><strong>1870s — A day school struggles</strong></h3>
    <p>Indian Agent J.J. (John James) Critchlow was the first Uintah Valley agent to attempt opening a school for the Utes, starting with a day school in 1874. It would open and close, for lack of funds and interest, as Critchlow argued unsuccessfully for the funds to open a boarding school.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=368999" target="_blank"><strong>1874:</strong> </a>“We hope to have … our school in operation this fall.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369068" target="_blank"><strong>1875:</strong> </a>“We must have another building, for boarding and lodging purposes.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369562" target="_blank"><strong>1876:</strong> </a>“I did not think the results justified the expense. I … closed the school.”</p>
    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6642kdx/369650" target="_blank"><strong>1877:</strong></a> “Our school has been suspended … for the want of funds.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369721" target="_blank"><strong>1878:</strong> </a>“I sincerely hope … that greater facilities may be afforded for their moral training.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369797&q=Utah&parent_i=369825" target="_blank"><strong>1879:</strong> </a>“... Best results can only be secured by a boarding industrial school, where the children … can be separated from their families.” </p>
    <h3>1880s — Uintah Boarding School opens</h3>
    <p>Agent J. J. Critchlow succeeded in convincing the Presbyterian Board of Missions to open and run a boarding-school on the Uintah Valley reservation — but the church’s involvement would be short-lived. The new school opened in January 1881, and by 1883, the federal government had taken over. This decade saw a more rapid turnover of agents after Critchlow’s departure in 1883.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369886" target="_blank"><strong>1880:</strong> </a>“We …  hope to be ready by the 1st of November to inaugurate our school.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369905" target="_blank"><strong>1881:</strong> </a>“We … had certainly failed.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370121" target="_blank"><strong>1882:</strong> </a>“I am somewhat at a loss to know … whether to call it a success or a failure.” <br />This was Critchlow’s last year as agent.</p>

    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370231" target="_blank"><strong>1883: </strong></a> “Much prejudice exists … against the children attending school.”<br /> Elisha W. Davis, new Indian agent</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370333" target="_blank"><strong>1884: </strong></a> “The pupils made gratifying progress … They had regular hours for work.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370475" target="_blank"><strong>1885:</strong> </a>“They are so intimately connected with the tribe, even when they are at school.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370596" target="_blank"><strong>1886:</strong> </a>The Utes’  “wishes in this respect should not be consulted.” <br />Eugene E. White, special agent temporarily in charge, brought a harsher outlook. </p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370711" target="_blank"><strong>1887:</strong> </a>“More room and better buildings are needed.”<br />New Indian Agent T.A. (Timothy) Byrnes</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=370763" target="_blank"><strong>1888:</strong> </a>“The building is in a very dilapidated condition; in fact it is scarcely habitable.”<br />With: Superintendent  Fannie A. Weeks: “Forty-four pupils were crowded into it, although its capacity is for only twenty-five.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=369195&q=Utah&parent_i=369253" target="_blank"><strong>1889:</strong> </a>“The building is a miserable dilapidated structure.” <br />This is Byrnes’ last year as agent.</p>

White in 1893 about his work at reservations across the country, including at the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation.</figcaption>

    <h3>1890s — Ouray Boarding School opens</h3>
    <p>Efforts to get Ute children into school intensified this decade, as new buildings were added at the Uintah school in Whiterocks and a second boarding school opened for the Uncompahgre band. But parents continued to resist sending their children.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/T-21922.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>1890:</strong> </a>Staff “labor under great difficulties” with “dilapidated” Uintah school building. <br />New Indian Agent Robert Waugh</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=371417" target="_blank"><strong>1891:</strong> </a>“Two large and commodious buildings … are nearing completion” at Uintah.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=371630" target="_blank"><strong>1892:</strong> </a>“It remains to be seen how well this [Ouray] school will be sustained with children.”</p>
    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=371800" target="_blank"><strong>1893:</strong> </a>“The Ute has much yet to learn in his estimate of schools.” <br />This was the year the Ouray Boarding School opened, and was Robert Waugh’s last year as agent.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=372019" target="_blank"><strong>1894:</strong> </a>“They are slow to appreciate school privileges that have been provided for them.” <br />New Indian Agent Major James F. Randlett</p>
    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=372222&q=Utah+&parent_i=372321" target="_blank"><strong>1895:</strong> </a>“The hope of civilizing these Utes centers in the reservation schools.”</p>
    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=372430" target="_blank"><strong>1896:</strong> </a>Children “visit their homes only during vacation … Runaways have been promptly returned.”</p>
    <p> <a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=372605" target="_blank"><strong>1897:</strong></a> “Even the smallest girls were required to do such work as they could.” <br />This was James F. Randlett’s last year as agent.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=372800" target="_blank"><strong>1898:</strong> </a>“Some of the parents object to their children doing any work unless they receive pay.”<br />James F. Randlett had been succeeded in July 1897 by another Army captain, who was quickly replaced in turn by U.S. Army Captain George A. Cornish.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=373041&q=Uintah&parent_i=373133" target="_blank"><strong>1899:</strong> </a>School attendance “is still far from satisfactory.”<br />H.P. Myton took over as the new Indian agent in October 1898.</p>

    <h3>1900s —</h3>
    <p>The Ouray school at Randlett was abandoned this decade, with all Utes encouraged to send their children to Whiterocks. A few were sent to boarding schools in other states, including the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=373360" target="_blank"><strong>1900:</strong> </a>“Rounding up the children.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=373762" target="_blank"><strong>1901:</strong> </a>“Then in December came the catastrophe.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=373989&q=Uinta&parent_i=374024" target="_blank"><strong>1902:</strong> </a>“It is very difficult to keep them from talking their own language.”<br />This is Myton’s last year as agent.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=374173&q=Uinta&parent_i=374284" target="_blank"><strong>1903:</strong> </a>New agent’s complaint: “the unsubdued attitude of the Utes.” <br />Capt. W.A. Mercer took over as the new agent.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=374451&q=Uinta&parent_i=374540" target="_blank"><strong>1904:</strong> </a>“It is a very difficult task to get these children in school.”<br />Another new Indian agent, C. G. Hall, took over in July 1904.</p>
    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=374729" target="_blank"><strong>1905:</strong> </a>Ouray Boarding School: “Steps are now being taken to abandon this school.”</p>

    <p><a href="https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=375004" target="_blank"><strong>1906:</strong> </a>The opening of the reservation “is bringing radical changes.”<br />C. G. Hall</p>
    <p>This was the last year the federal government published the individual reports from agents and school superintendents; for the next two two decades and more, national reports would include only statistics from individual schools, with occasional changes in the data collected.</p>
