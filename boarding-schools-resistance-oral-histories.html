    <p>Every time his parents dropped him off at boarding school, Muse Harris recalled he would quickly figure out a way to get out and go back to his home.  </p>

        <p>Most of the time, he said, he and his brother Pat would dig holes under the fences that surrounded the boarding school in the little town of Whiterocks on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. </p>
        <p>“We’d take off,” he recounted. “We’d make for that hole, and we’d walk or run or bum a ride, anyway we could get home from there.” </p>
        <p>It happened again and again. One April, he said, his parents — who were forced to enroll their kids — took the brothers back to the school. “That night we was back home,” Harris said. “We never stayed.” </p>
        <p>Harris, who is Ute, also went to the second boarding school that operated on the reservation in nearby Randlett for a short time before it closed. </p>
        <p>He spoke to an interviewer in 1968 for an oral history about his time at the boarding schools. </p>
        <p>Those records are some of the only accounts of what students experienced in both Whiterocks and Randlett — in their own words. When they were enrolled, students were disciplined for speaking ill of the schools; the interviews, collected years later, are the first time some of the accounts were ever documented. </p>
        <p>The University of Utah hosts the largest repository of oral histories from the Ute Tribe with its Doris Duke collection. Those are in the Marriott Library’s Special Collections and available at request. And librarians are currently working to digitize them. </p>
        <p>Researcher Kim Gruenwald also included transcripts from several interviews in the draft for her thesis project on Ute education for Utah State University in 1989. Those include conversations with: Forrest Cuch, Gloria Thompson and Bob Chapoose. Cuch’s mother went to the Whiterocks boarding school, and he later experienced discrimination in the public schools; Thompson experienced the same. Chapoose attended the Whiterocks school. </p>
        <p>The U.’s collections include student accounts and recollections from tribal members who worked at them. </p>
        <p>Here’s a breakdown of some of the oral histories there and where to find them: </p>

    <h3>Muse Harris </h3>
        <p><strong> Box 8, No. 195  </strong></p>
        <p>Harris talks about how he “didn’t take too much schooling” at the boarding schools. He was transferred to a public school in Vernal, and finished classes there through the eighth grade. </p>
        <p>He said he regretted not learning as much as he wanted to. </p>
        <p>Harris recounted: “If I had any more grades why I wouldn’t been here now. I might’ve been in the White House. Well, I didn’t learn much, but I’m a kind of funny, I can tell a story and remember pretty good, but by jimminey, I’m not right up qualified like I should be. I know now what I should’a done. But I’ll tell ‘ya, all you kids, by jimminey, if you want to make good, you just go to school and finish up. Don’t quit just as soon as you pass on from the eighth grade.” </p>

        <p><strong> Box 1, No. 5, 7, 8  </strong></p>
        <p>Conner Chapoose describes the transition for Ute kids from the boarding school at Whiterocks, which closed in 1952, to the public schools in the Uinta Basin. </p>
        <p>Families in the tribe, he said, “pretty much faced that we have to go to school, that the law meant for us to go to school and to acquire, to get to know the knowledge of the white people.” </p>
        <p>But the public school districts didn’t effectively serve Native children. Chapoose said Ute students often sat in the back of the class and got called “dumb” by their white peers. </p>
        <p>White parents, he recalled, also told their kids: “Don’t you play with that filthy Indian.”</p>
        <p>The result was that Ute kids didn’t do as well in school as he feels they should’ve and could’ve. </p>

        <p>Lula Wash Chapoose Brock is quoted as saying about Ute kids in school: “Some of them don’t do so good and then some goes to drinking and that’s what spoils it.” </p>

    <h3>Ina Lou Chapoose and Marrietta Reed </h3>
        <p><strong> Box 4, No. 65  </strong></p>
        <p>Ina Lou Chapoose and Marrietta Reed worked at the Head Start program for the tribe to help Ute kids learn better in school. They describe having story time, songs and crafts that worked well for Native students. About 15 were enrolled at the time. </p>
        <p>Chapoose said Ute parents “have now come to realize how important education is to our children.”</p>

        <p><strong> Box 4, No. 66 </strong></p>
        <p>Hal Albert Daniels Sr. attended the boarding school at Whiterocks, starting when he was 5 years old. </p>
        <p>“I was pretty young,” he said. “… They just built them great big buildings they used to have up there — the boys’ dormitory and the girls’ dormitory, then the boys’ room.”  </p>
        <p>He then went to a boarding school in Grand Junction, Colorado, for a year in 1893. And after that, he was transferred to the Carlisle Industrial Boarding School in Pennsylvania. </p>
        <p>“And you got a lot of discipline there,” he said. “They had a lot of it.” </p>

        <p>Ethel Daniels Kolb said she went to the Whiterocks school for a short time before also being transferred to Carlisle. </p>
        <p>“A wagon picked me up at the farm, and we went as far as Wells Station, between Myton and Nine Mile,” she said. “My how sad I was thinking of Mother and Mentora alone on the big farm, and I wouldn’t see them again for five years. You know we had to stay that long when we went away to school.”</p>
        <p>The first three weeks at Carlisle, she said, were the worst. </p>
        <p>“I cried a lot and wanted to go home so badly, but of course I couldn’t,” she said. </p>
        <p>She mentioned learning to sew there. She also noted other Ute students there with her: Dick Quip, Laura Taylor, Lottie Sireech, Robert Ouray and Fred Mart. Sireech died at Carlisle. </p>
        <p>“Boarding schools are fine, when you get over being home-sick,” Kolb said. “I know we learned a lot and met lots of other people.”</p>

    <h3>Cecelia Panteloon Lambeth</h3>
        <p><strong> Box 11, No. 366  </strong></p>
        <p>Cecelia Panteloon Lambeth recalled attending Whiterocks and talked about her teachers there, all of whom she said were white. </p>
        <p>They included: Mrs. Wapstock, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Phillips. </p>
        <p>Lambeth said she attended school there through the fourth grade and then transferred to a school in Salt Lake City for a year. “That was the last time I ever went to school,” she said. </p>
        <p>The interviewer asked Lambeth if her parents were resistant to sending her to school. </p>
        <p>“They were just the old Indian type that didn’t, they didn’t have any education themselves, either, and they just didn’t, I guess they didn’t care whether we went to school or not,” Lambeth responded. </p>
        <p>She noted her parents didn’t speak any English. </p>
        <p>Lambeth also said she thinks the boarding schools, as well as the public schools, didn’t know how to teach Native kids. </p>
        <p>“A lot of these Indian children down here went to school and they never learned anything, in fact, they, I guess the teachers didn’t like too much time with them,” she said. “They just, you know, just let them pass. I know some young men and women down there that went to as far as eleventh grade or on up, and they just, they can’t hardly read.” </p>
        <p>But she said she considered education what the Utes needed most. </p>
        <p>“Yes, I think Indians have just as good a chance as a white person has, if they have the education and the training for the job,” Lambeth said. </p>

        <p><strong> Box 11, No. 371  </strong></p>
        <p>Clarice Pawwannie said she’s heard about the mistreatment of Ute students by their teachers in the public schools, but her daughter, Linda, didn’t experience that. </p>
        <p>Linda talked about attending Union High School and planning to go to college with her friends. But she said she would’ve liked to learn more about “how our people lived and stuff before” while she was in school. </p>

        <p><strong> Box 11, No. 372; Box 17, No. 605  </strong></p>
        <p>Reed, who worked in the Head Start program, also said she wanted more Native curriculum in schools. </p>
        <p>“I feel in a way we have lost true identity as Indians,” she said. “We were the first people that were to be here on this earth, as I have gathered. And I think it would mean a lot because in some way our young children have lost their identity as the Indian people.” </p>
        <p>Reed said she was worried about youth no longer knowing about their culture. </p>
        <p>“We should continue to teach our Indian children to speak the Ute Indian language,” she said. “And so many of our young people have forgotten. They have even forgotten how to talk it. Some of them don’t even know anything about Ute Indian people.” </p>
        <p>She urged the Ute Tribe to work with the schools. Reed mentioned some Ute kids participating in the Latter-Day Saint Placement program, but she felt schools were a better place for them to learn. </p>
        <p>She said there is still “the feeling that we are not quite welcome in the non-Indian society as of yet,” but she hoped it could be addressed through education. </p>

        <p>Joseph Pinnecoose was a Ute student in the public schools who later went on to attend Brigham Young University. </p>
        <p>But his time at BYU was a challenge, he told an interviewer, and he flunked out. “It seemed that I couldn’t get any help all that time,” he said. </p>
        <p>He said he wanted to try another college where there were more Native students like him. </p>
        <p>“I want to go where there’s Indians,” Pinnecoose said. “I would like to go to a school in South Dakota, but I don’t know. It really makes me feel like being around Indians more, rather than being around with the Anglo.” </p>
        <p>Pinnecoose also encouraged public K-12 schools in the Uinta Basin to teach Ute culture and history. But he said traditional songs and dances should be kept only within the tribe. </p>

        <p><strong> Box 17, No. 606  </strong></p>
        <p>Katherine Jenks noted in her interview that she saw education improving for her kids in the public school system: “And I guess, this goes to show that we really have to put our efforts in ourselves to help these kids in every way we can, so that they can get better education that we did when we were little.” </p>

        <p>Glenna Jenks, Katherine Jenks’ daughter, talked about being an A student in public schools. </p>
        <p>She said it took hard work and diligence and propelled her to later win the title of Miss Utah Indian. </p>
        <p>When the interviewer asked what advice she had for other Ute students, Jenks said: “Most of all concentrate on your work. No matter if people are picking on you or things like this. … No matter if your skin is one color or a different color. It’s just a matter of having faith within yourself. And you can do it.” </p>
        <p>She said she wanted to attend college so she could become a teacher and help Ute kids graduate. </p>
        <p>Jenks said some Native children choose to go shoot pool instead of attending classes. </p>
        <p>“Maybe it is a type of inferiority that they have. I know sometimes I feel this,” she said.</p>
        <p>She also mentioned a girl she went to school with, who sat at the back of the class and rarely participated. “And today I look at her, she’s adjusted sort of, she accepts her role as being a ‘D’ student, she accepts her role as being that inferior type of person.” </p>
