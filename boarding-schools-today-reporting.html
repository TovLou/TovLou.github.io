    <p>Two boarding schools on the Ute Tribe’s reservation failed to effectively educate Native students. And that legacy echoes in public schools today.</p>

    <p>It’s a troubling disparity that The Salt Lake Tribune has spent the past year investigating.</p>
    <p>Reporter Courtney Tanner examined hundreds of pages of records, from the boarding school era to the transition to public schools to recent grades, ACT scores and graduation rates in the Uintah and Duchesne school districts.</p>
    <p>Those districts split the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in eastern Utah and serve about 800 Native students — largely Utes — between them.</p>
    <p>Ute kids singularly fall behind in every metric and have for decades.</p>
    <p>“There was never really a commitment to educate our kids,” said Forrest Cuch, a former education leader for the tribe. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t be seeing this pattern for so long.”</p>
    <p>Here’s a breakdown of each part of The Tribune’s series and where to read them:</p>
    <h3>Part one: Harsh disparities</h3>
    <p>Ute kids see the lowest test scores and drop out of school at the highest rates anywhere in Utah.</p>
        <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/07/10/ute-tribes-kids-have-been-failed/">The Ute Tribe’s kids have been failed by the public school system more than any other students in Utah.</a>
    <h3>Part two: Red flags</h3>
    <p>Warnings have continued for decades, but nothing has changed.</p>
        <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/07/10/experts-know-how-educate-native/">The Ute Tribe is trying to make up for the state’s education shortcomings, but resources are limited.</a>
    <h3>Part three: Generational failure</h3>
    <p>Experts know how to educate Native kids. Uinta Basin school districts aren’t doing it.</p>
        <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/07/10/experts-know-how-educate-native/">The Ute Tribe is trying to make up for the state’s education shortcomings, but resources are limited.</a>
    <h3>One solution: Tribal school</h3>
    <p>The Ute Tribe runs its own high school, where students are learning their culture — and succeeding.</p>
