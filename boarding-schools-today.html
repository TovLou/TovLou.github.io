                <p>“The lack of a push in education fundamentals would haunt me, especially with grammar and spelling,” writes Joseph DuShane-Navanick, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe. “... I had to substitute words that I wanted to say for words I could spell.” He began his higher education at Salt Lake Community Collge and is planning to attend the University of Utah next year.</p>

                <p>“Shortly after applying [the the University of Utah,], I was denied admission. Feeling defeated, I relied on my cultural teachings that my family has instilled. During this time, my father gave me strength with the words, “If you really want this opportunity, offer a word of prayer. That’s what we do when we face barriers.” Ungatavinekent-Duncan is now the advisor for the Inter-Tribal Student Association and engagement person for Native American folks with the Center for Equity and Student Belonging at the U.</p>

<!--            <figcaption><cite class="image-credit">Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune</cite> Nancy Poowegup told Salt Lake Tribune reporter Courtney Tanner that her late mother was forced to attend the Indian boarding school in Whiterocks as a teenager and refused to talk much about what she experienced there. Poowegup wore a bright pair of blue and yellow beaded earrings to the Bear Dance in Whiterocks in May 2022 as a way to honor her.</figcaption>-->

    <p>The two boarding schools on the Ute Indian Tribe’s reservation failed to effectively educate Ute students — and that legacy echoes in public schools today. Reporter Courtney Tanner has spent the past year investigating disparities in the public school districts in the Uintah Basin. The conclusion: Ute kids singularly fall behind in every metric and have for decades.</p>
    <p class="overflow-hidden">“There was never really a commitment to educate our kids,” said Forrest Cuch, a former education leader for the tribe. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t be seeing this pattern for so long.”
