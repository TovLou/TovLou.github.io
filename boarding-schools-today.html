    <p>The two boarding schools on the Ute Indian Tribe’s reservation failed to effectively educate Ute students — and that legacy echoes in public schools today. Reporter Courtney Tanner has spent the past year investigating disparities in the public school districts in the Uinta Basin. The conclusion: Ute kids singularly fall behind in every metric and have for decades.</p>
    <p class="overflow-hidden">“There was never really a commitment to educate our kids,” said Forrest Cuch, a former education leader for the tribe. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t be seeing this pattern for so long.”
